                    Tailwind Track Club (Tailwind TC) is a competitive youth track & field and cross country club based in Westchester, NY supporting athletes (6-18) from beginner to elite.  Our philosophy is to provide a venue for young people to experience the joy of a healthy lifestyle, develop lasting friendships and challenge themselves to achieve personal goals.<br><br>We strive to provide our athletes with an experience that allows them to build confidence, learn life lessons and create lasting friendships.
                    Given the fact that our coaches are both parents and accomplished athletes, we are able to strike a crucial balance between structured training and nurturing our athletes. <br><br>In keeping with our philosophy, we utilize the tools available to elite athletes (structured training, physiology evaluation, strength training, nutrition guidance, etc.) while avoiding the high volume that leads to burnout.
                    Track & field and cross country are ranked #1 for participation in middle school and high school sports.  If your youth athlete is interested in running, would like to compete at the middle school / high school level or just wants to have fun while improving their athletic skills, Tailwind Track Club is a great option.
                    <br><br>- Carl Curran, founder and Head Coach
