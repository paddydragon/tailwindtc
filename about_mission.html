                    The Tailwind Track Club (Tailwind TC) is a competitive youth track & field and cross country club based in Westchester, NY targeting athletes (6-18) from beginner to elite.  The philosophy of the club is to provide a venue for young people to experience the joy of a healthy lifestyle, develop lasting friendships and challenge themselves to achieve personal goals.<br><br>We aim to provide our athletes with an outlet that allows them to build confidence, learn life lessons and create lasting friendships.
                    Given the fact that our coaches are both parents and accomplished athletes, we are able to strike a balance between structured training and nurturing our athletes. <br><br> Our coaching is based on a training philosophy that utilizes the tools available to elite athletes (structured training, physiology evaluation, strength training, nutrition guidance, etc.) but without the high volume that could lead to burnout.
                    Track & field and cross country are ranked #1 for participation in middle school and high school sports.  If your youth athlete is interested in running, would like to compete at the middle school / high school level or just wants to have fun while improving their athletic skills, Tailwind Track Club provides a great alternative for them.
                    <br><br>- Carl Curran, founder and Head Coach
